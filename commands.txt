In the **DNA Sequence Analysis Tool**, hereâ€™s what you can input into the provided tabs:

### **1. Input DNA Sequence**
- Go to the **sidebar** and paste a valid DNA sequence in the text box.
- Example:
  ```
  ATGCGTACGTTAGC
  ```
  - The sequence can contain only **A, T, G, or C** (case-insensitive).
  - Avoid including spaces, numbers, or special characters.

---

### **2. Mutation Finder**
- After entering a valid DNA sequence, scroll to the **Mutation Finder** section.
- Input a **mutated version of the DNA sequence** to compare it with the original.
- Example:
  - Original Sequence: `ATGCGTACGTTAGC`
  - Mutated Sequence: `ATGCGGACGTTAGT`
    - The tool will highlight the positions and details of the mutations:
      - Position 6: Original = T, Mutated = G
      - Position 13: Original = C, Mutated = T

---

### **3. Sequence Motif Finder**
- Scroll to the **Sequence Motif Finder** section.
- Enter a **short DNA motif** (a pattern of nucleotides) to search for in the original sequence.
- Example:
  - DNA Sequence: `ATGCGTACGTTAGC`
  - Motif: `CGT`
    - The tool will show positions where the motif occurs:
      - Found at positions: 3, 8

---

### Example Workflow
1. Enter the DNA sequence: `ATGCGTACGTTAGC`.
2. For Mutation Finder, input a mutated sequence like `ATGCGGACGTTAGT`.
3. For Motif Finder, search for a motif like `CGT`.

The tool will provide analyses based on the input you provide in each section.
