## **How to Use**
### **1. Installation**
To get started, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit biopython
```

### **2. Launch the Application**
Run the app locally with:
```bash
streamlit run dna_analysis_tool.py
```

### **3. Navigate Between Tools**
- Enter your DNA sequence in the sidebar.  
- Use the navigation menu to switch between tools:
  - Reverse Complement
  - GC Content Calculator
  - Mutation Finder
  - Motif Finder

## **Example Workflow**
1. **Input DNA Sequence**:  
   Paste your DNA sequence (e.g., `ATGCGTACGTTAGC`) in the sidebar.  

2. **Analyze**:  
   - **Reverse Complement**: See the complementary strand in reverse order.  
   - **GC Content**: Get the GC percentage (e.g., 42.86%).  
   - **Mutation Finder**: Compare mutated sequence (e.g., `ATGCGGACGTTAGC`) to identify differences.  
   - **Motif Finder**: Search for patterns (e.g., `CGT` found at positions 3 and 8).  

3. **Results**:  
   Get instant results for your analysis!
